This project develops a comprehensive Multi Disease Prediction System utilizing machine learning models to predict four major diseases: Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Diabetes,
and Breast Cancer. Our system employs data visualization techniques to provide insights into each dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables. Users
can access tailored visualizations according to their requirements, enabling personalized exploration of the data. The system achieves high accuracy in predicting disease onset, with a
comparative analysis of three machine learning models demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we integrate a medical store feature, offering relevant medications and
treatments for each predicted disease.
